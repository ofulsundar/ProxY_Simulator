# SpotProxy Simulation Modules

This repository includes core modules for simulating different proxy and censorship strategies.

---

## Modules

### 1. **Minimized_SpotProxy_Version**
Simulates various proxy strategies using a simplified and optimized structure.  
Supported modes:
- `strict`
- `kind`
- `random`
- `broadcast`
- `fixed`

---

### 2. **MultiCensor_Simulations**
Extends the minimized SpotProxy version by adding multiple censors.  
Used to simulate more complex and layered censorship scenarios.

---

### 3. **sim_core**
The core simulation engine used by `Minimized_SpotProxy_Version`.  
Contains the essential logic and state handling.

---

## Usage
Each module can be run independently.  
Adjust parameters in each module to test different proxy or censor behaviors.
